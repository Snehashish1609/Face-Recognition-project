**Bringing innovation in traditional checkout systems using Facial Recognition**

## Abstract
In retail settings, customer satisfaction is generally associated with the overall evaluation of a store i.e. store image. Waiting for service is not part of the store image dimensions, but it does play an increasingly important role in the retail experience where waits are often inevitable. In the present generation where everything happens so fast, waiting for service is not something anyone wants at all.  It has been noticed that waiting for service at the checkout creates a negative emotional response among the customers[1]. Every store let it be retail or of a food chain has a checkout system for its general customers. So, to make the workflow better and have a positive impact on the customers, checkout systems have to be faster and that is what we are aiming to do by using the latest technology in the computer vision domain i.e. Face Recognition.
The face is an important part of the human body, distinguishing individuals in large groups of people. Thus, because of its universality and uniqueness, it has become the most widely used and accepted biometric method. The domain of face recognition has gained the attention of many scientists, and hence it has become a standard benchmark in the area of human recognition. By using Face Recognition we are aiming to make the wait for service shorter, eventually making the checkout experience better.
